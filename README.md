# Citi Bike Trips Analysis 

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the project is to analyze the Citi bike rides in NYC for the month of Aug 2019 from a customer and usage standpoint and gain insights on the bikesharing business so that it can be used to help develop a business case for a bikesharing business elsewhere.

More than half of Citi Bikes riders were male and only about a quarter of them were female.

The most popular times for usage were 5 & 6 PM and 8 AM implying that bike usage may be influenced by the 9-5 work hours.

Most users checked out their bikes for less than 1 hour; 5 min trips were the most common trip duration.

The most frequent checkout times duration was consistent across genders.

Overall, usage seemed to be the highest on the weekends and during peak hours on the weekdays.

This was consistent across genders. Considerably more men used shared bikes than women and unknown gender users.

Subcribers used the shared bikes more frequently than non-subscribers. Non-subscribers used the bikes most frequently on the weekends. 

## Summary 

Most of the people who used the shared bikes were male, and the people who used them most frequently were subscribers. It appears that people used the bikes either for work reasons (rush hour) or leisure reasons (weekends). Subscribers may have used the bikes most frequently because they were using them for work and leisure reasons.

Two additional visualizations that can be produced for future analysis include the following:
* A visualization of where users started their rides
* A visualization of where users ended their rides
